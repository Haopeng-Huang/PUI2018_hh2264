## Clarity
The title does a good job of describing the map. I suggest adding a gradient scale bar somewhere so that the reader knows what the colors indicate. I do not understand what the axes are measuring along the edges. It may be good to remove these if they do not added necessary information. I would suggest adding information on what the areas are that you are aggregating information on (PUMA, county, district, etc.).  

## Esthetic
I think a gradient was a good choice here, but I would suggest using different colors for two reasons: one, the colors do not contrast enough to make small differences clear and two, the pink and purple are likely not easy for most colorblind people to see. I would suggest maybe using blue and yellow, or a choice from color palettes developed for the colorblind. I would also make the title larger.

## Honesty
The map does not appear to be distorted. The colors make sense if pink is high density and blue is low density. Better contrast of colors and labeling what the colors mean numerically will make it more clear how different the densities are. Right now, most places do not appear very different from one another.
